        inevitable for any organisation nowadays. We at ADOSAT have expertise in creating applications
        and web pages that will lure the customers towards the organisation with extreme comfort. For
        an application to be successful, there are certain requisites that has to be fulfilled.
        The application should be extremely user friendly and it should be developed by keeping

        , then you are at the right place</string>
    <string name="workshops">College students are the main target for our workshops.
        Both technical and behavioural skills are concentrated in this workshop.
        These workshops are places where experience and expertise plays the main role.
        Professors and professionals from highly reputed institutions are called for guest culture and training.
        Technical  lessons are compressed and presented to you without any dilution. Teaching through fun methods

    <string name="androidappdevelop">Android is the operating system which is predominantly
        used in mobile phones throughout the world. So an app that is supported by the android
        OS is the one which will have larger reach. We at ADOSAT develop android applications
        as per the client needs in a very user friendly way. Android apps are designed for large
        audience and hence it is very important that it should be simple and easily understandable.
        we know the pulse of the users and develop it accordingly.</string>

    <string name="iosappdevelopemnt">iphone users are increasing day by day and they feel that they
        should enjoy all the features and apps that android users have. The apps for the ios should be
        classy  and we make it exactly the same way. Ios  is not mobile friendly and hence  it is the
        responsibility of the app developers to make the app as user friendly as possible and still make
        it in the Ios style.  Higher class people make sure that they own only the iphone and hence if the
        app is targeted for them, then it should be runnable in Ios.</string>

    <string name="winappdevelopment">Windows are the most widely used operating system in any device
        and the it has been and is still ruling the IT world. Nokia one of the oldest and most famous
        of the cell phone manufacturers use windows as their operating system. We at ADOSAT develop apps
        which are supported by windows in any of the devices ranging from desktops to cell phones.
        The best part of windows is that , we can access any app that we are using in our cell phone,
        in our laptop in time of crisis.</string>

    <string name="crossplatformapp">An app is always aimed for a huge audience.
        But we should also see to that if the app will be relatable to world audience.
        We will data mine about all the places that the client is targeting and find out if
        the app will be usable for the people in those countries. If not we will customise the
        app according to the regions in which the app is aiming to spread. This brings in a cross
        culture relationship[with different parts of the world and the fame of our country will also grow if
        our app hits the right cord.</string>

    <string name="projectsmain">We at ADOSAT also undertake the final year projects and mini projects
        for engineering students in the civil and mechanical streams. We also provide authorised IEEE
        projectWe do not make the entire project and give you hints to present them but we guide you
        through every step of the project. The motto of  giving the project is to explore new technology
        and gain some knowledge out of it. Hence we provide training classes. The kits, and software that
        are required for executing the projects are all available with us and we will glide you through the
        project comfortably.</string>
